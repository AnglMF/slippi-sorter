# Slippi Sorter

## Purpose
This script is designed for use after a play session using slippi. You'll ideally take the generated Slippi folder with the generated slp files to be sorted for organizing, put it inside the root of this project (run this script) and then rename the Slippi folder and store it somewhere for later review.
